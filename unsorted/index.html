        What is a Web Server?
        =====================
        - A program running on a machine waiting for web requests.
        - Client sends HTTP request with an HTTP method
        - Server sends HTTP response to the client

        What is a Framework?
        ====================
        - Similar to a library that provides a set functions and classes
        - Helps speed up development and make development easier
        - Is more opinionated than a libary
        - Has a set of rules in order to use the framework
        - Rules such as folder structures and naming

        curl
        ====
        $ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/users
        $ curl -X POST &lt;REQUEST_URL&gt;                  // -X changes HTTP method
        $ curl -v &lt;REDIRECT_URL&gt;                      // -v stands for verbose and prints more information such as headers


        Importance of Testing
        =====================
        - Automated checks
            - Notification of changes that break existing code
        - Test edge cases
        - Speeds up development
        - Improves maintainability
        - Promotes reusable and modular code

        Types of Testing
        ================
        - Unit Test
            - Testing an individual component such as a function
        - Integration Test
            - Testing multiple components
            - Testing the interaction between components
        - End-to-End Test
            - The entire process is tested
            - There may be multiple processes
