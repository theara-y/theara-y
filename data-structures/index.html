        Map
        ===
        - hashmaps 
        - key/value

        Lists
        =====
        - Abstract data type
        - Multiple items
        - Insert and delete at any position
        - Can contain duplicates

        Arrays
        ======
        - Collection of items at sequential and equally-spaced memory
        - O(1) retrieving
        - O(n) searching
        - O(n) insert - shifting items over
        - O(n) delete

        Direct Arrays / Vectors
        =======================
        - Same data type
            - all numbers
            - same string length
        - Javascript provides typed arrays


        Indirect Arrays
        ===============
        - Array of references not values
        - Store different data types in an array
        - Javascript uses indirect arrays 

        Linked Lists
        ============
        - abstract data type
        - items are not store in contiguous memory
        - each node references another node
            - on nothing if it is the last node
        - rearrangeable without moving other items in memory
        - bunch of nodes linked sequentially
        - has a reference to head
        - print each node
        - find node by value
        - append to end
        - insert at specific position
        - remove a node
        - tail to make append to end O(1)
        - next item is O(1)
        - searching is O(n)
        - insert and delete O(n)
        - head and tail O(1)
        - doubly linked list
            - next and previous, bi-directional


        Writing A Node
        ==============
        class Node {
            constructor(val, next=null) {
                this.val = val;
                this.next = next;
            }
        }

        new Node(1, new Node(2, new Node(3)));

        class LinkedList {
            constructor() {
                this.head = null
            }

            find() {
                while(current) {
                    if current == val
                    current = current.next
                }
            }

            append() {
                last_node.next = new Node()
            }
        }

        List Abstract Data Type (ADT)
        =============================
        - Keep multiple items
        - Insert and delete at any position
        - Can contain duplicates
        - Preserves the order of items
        
        Stacks
        ======
        - FILO
        - return to previous state
        - push, added to the top of the stack
        - pop, removed from the top of the stack
        - arrays, linked lists
        - object not good

        Queues
        ======
        - FIFO
        - enqueue items are added to the end of the queue
        - dequeue items are removed from the front of the queue
        - peek() returns first item to remove but do not remove
        - isEmpty() are there items 
        - linked lists
        - arrays not good

        Deques
        ======
        - Double ended queue
        - push, pop, shift, and unshift in O(1)
        - appendleft, appendright, popleft, popright, peekleft, peekright, isEmpty

        Priority Queue
        ==============
        - Item added with priority
        - Highest priority is removed
        - add(priority, item)
        - poll() - remove and return highest priority
        - unsorted/sorted O(n) using arrays, linked lists, and bidirection linked lists
        - heaps are most efficient


        Recursion
        =========
        - function that calls itself
        - any loop can be rewritten recursively, vice versa
        - base case that stops recursion
        - no base case, stack overflow
        - recursive patterns
            - filesystems, nested directories
            - fractals
            - parsing
            - nested data
        - O(n^2) when making a new array with each call
        - O(n) if we track the index

        Hash Tables
        ===========
        - Maps abstract data type
        - Wikipedia: In computing, it is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots from which the desired value can be found.
        - hash function to compute an index
        - hash function O(1)
        - speed and wide distribution
        - fast hashing and crypto hashing
        - separate chaining
        - dynamic resizing, 75% occupied
        - set and delete calls can take longer
        - open addressing 
        - double hashing
        - set is a map without values
