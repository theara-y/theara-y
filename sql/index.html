        What is a database?
        ===================
        - A database is a collection of data organized to be efficiently stored, access, and managed.
        - Database can refer to the database server software, the data records, or the physical machine that holds data.
        - Benefits
            - Data is stored, managed, and accessed efficiently.
            - Configure different levels of authorizations
        - Database in the web stack
            - Client (Frontend)
                - Client sends a request
                - Receives a response from the server
                - HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, React, Angular, Vue
            - Server (Backend)
                - Server listens for request
                - Queries the database for requested data
                - Build a response to send back to the client
                - Flask, Django, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Express.js, Java, Spring
            - Database (Backend)
                - Stores data
                - Provides the server with data
                - PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Cassandra, OracleDB, Redis, RDMS, NoSQL

        Relational Database
        ===================
        - Model data as rows and columns of tabular data
            - Tables
            - Spreadsheets
        - Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
            - Software/interface that is run to communicate queries
        - Schema
            - A logical representation of database including its tables, columns, data types, constraints
        - Table
            - A set of column or rows like a spreadsheet
        - Column
            - A table attribute 
        - Row
            - A table record with a set of values for columns 


        PostgreSQL
        ==========
        - Open source RDBMS
        - Powerful, popular, follows SQL standard closely
        - database files is distributed elsewhere on the machine
        - psql
        - Seeding a database
            - Feeding data into a database
        - SQL
            - Structured Query Language
            - human readable language used to query relational databases
            - Strings are case-sensitive
            - Single quotes
            - End commands with semi-colon ;
            - ALL_CAPS for keywords, but is not required

        Installing PostgreSQL
        =====================
        - psql
            - a terminal based program for issuing database commands
        $ sudo apt-get install postgresql
        $ sudo service postgresql status
        $ sudo service postgresql start
        $ sudo service postgresql stop
        $ psql
        $ psql database_name
        $ psql < my_script.sql
        $ sudo -u postgres createuser -s $(whoami);
            - using postgres user create new user with super roles called $(whoami)
        $ sudo -u postgres createuser test
        $ sudo -u postgres dropuser test
        $ createuser --interactive
        psql$ ALTER USER username WITH PASSWORD password
        psql$ ALTER USER username WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD password
        psql$ GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE lunchly TO testuser;
        psql$ GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO testuser;
        psql$ SELECT schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata
        $ createdb database_name
        $ dropdb database_name
        $ pg_dump -C -c -O database_name > backup.sql
        psql$ \l                    // List databases
        psql$ \q                    // Quit terminal/Ctrl+D 
        psql$ \c database_name      // Connect
        psql$ \dt                   // List tables
        psql$ \d table_name         // Table details
        psql$ \d+ table_name        // List cols and types
        psql$ \du
        psql$ \i data.sql
        psql$ SQL_QUERY

        \c database
        GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCE cities_id_seq TO www;
        GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO testuser;


        Data Definition Language (DDL)
        ==============================
        -- comments
        DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS database_name;
        CREATE DATABASE database_name;
        \c database_name
        CREATE TABLE table_name
        (
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            name TEXT VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
            age INTEGER CHECK (age <= 200),
            price FLOAT(2) NULL,
            modified DATE, TIMESTAMP
            flag BOOLEAN,
            ref_key INTEGER REFERENCES table_name (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
        );
        DROP TABLE table_name;

        DATA TYPES
        NULL
        CONSTRAINTS
            - Form of validation
        DEFAULT
            - Set to NULL
        ON DELETE SET NULL | ON DELETE CASCADE

        ALTER TABLE table_name
            ADD COLUMN column_name TYPE CONSTRAINTS
            DROP COLUMN column_name
            RENAME_COLUMN column_name TO column_name

        Crow's Foot Notation
        ====================
        - Entity Relationship Diagram to represent schemas
        - Relationship

        Normalization
        =============
        - Organize table to reduce redundancy and dependency
        - Break tables down into smaller ones and create relationships

        Indexing
        ========
        - Data structure that efficiently stores column values to speed up row retrieval via SELECT and WHERE
        - In general, database software use tree data structures to store data so that it can be retrieved in O(log n)
        - Tradeoff increased memory usage, copy of a column is stored in a tree structure and inserts and updates become more expensive
        - CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name)
            - Can be used anytime
            - More data = more time to create index
        - DROP INDEX index_name

        Data Manipulation Language (DML)
        ================================
        - A subset of SQL that involves querying and manipulating records
        - CRUD
            - Create,   INSERT INTO
            - Read,     SELECT ... FROM
            - Update,   UPDATE ... SET
            - Delete,   DELETE FROM
        - SELECT 2 + 5;

        Operators
            - =, >, >=, <, <=, !=, <>
            - IN, NOT IN, BETWEEN, AND, OR
            - LIKE, ILIKE (Not Standard), a%, a_
            - AS (optional)

        SELECT */cols FROM table_name
            - Subclauses
                1: FROM, JOIN
                2: WHERE
                3: GROUP BY
                    - Used with aggregate functions
                4: SELECT (Required)
                    - AGGREGATE: MAX, MIN, SUM, COUNT, AVG
                5: HAVING
                6: ORDER BY
                    - col ASC|DESC
                7: LIMIT
                8: OFFSET

        INSERT INTO table_name
            (col1, col2, col3, col4...)
        VALUES
            (r1c1, r1c2, r1c3, r1c4...),
            (r2c1, r2c2, r2c3, r2c4...);

        UPDATE table_name
        SET col = val
        WHERE expression;

        DELETE FROM table_name
        WHERE expression;

        Relationships
        =============
        - Normalization
            - Reducing redundancy
        - Primary Key, Foreign Key
        - One-to-Many
            - a has many b's
            - b's has only one a
            - b is referencing, a is referenced
        - Many-to-Many
            - Intermediate table

        JOINS
        =====
        - Creates a table in memory by combining tables
        - Data from table is matched according to a join condition 
        - Commonly joined on primary and foreign keys
        - Inner Join | Join
            - Only rows that match the condition in both tables
        - Outer
            - Left
                - All rows from the first table combined with matching rows in the second table
            - Right
                - All rows from the second table combined with matching rows in the first table
            - Full
                - All rows from both tables


        deploy on render
        ================
