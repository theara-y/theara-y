        Plaintext passwords
        ===================
        - Never implement
        - Access to database leaks all passwords
        - People reuse passwords

        What is hashing?
        ================
        - hash function maps data of arbitrary size to fixed size
        - determininstic - same output for the same input everytime
        - cryptographic hash - one way function, cannot reverse output to get input
            - abs function is one way

        Python hashing
        ==============
        - built in function called hash
            - cannot hash mutable data types
            - dictionaries and sets use a hashing function for keys

        Salting
        =======
        - Prevents reverse lookup of hash
        - Salt is a random string introduced during hashing
        - Attackers need to guess salt + password
        - Concatenated to the password and hashed together
        - Two people with the same password will have differnt hashes



        Algorithms
        ==========
        - Cryptographic Hashes
            - MD5
            - SHA
            - Fast, non reversible
        - Password hashing
            - Argon2
            - Bcrypt
            - Scrypt
            - Slower


        Python Bcrypt
        =============
        - pip install bcrypt
        - salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
        - b'$2b$12$hashed_salthashed_password
        - binary string
        - 2b - bcrypt identifier
        - 12 rounds, work factor
        - 21 characters salt hash
        - 31 characters password hash


        Flask Bcrypt
        ============
        - pip install flask-bcrypt
        - from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt
        - bcrypt.generate_password_hash('password')
        - hashed_utf8 = hashed.decode('utf8')
            - store in database
        - bcrypt.check_password(hash, 'password')
        - define function as methods as classmethods


        User Session
        ============
        - Store user_id in session
            - Can store user in g.user
