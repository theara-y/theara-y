        API Requests
        ============
        - Client side requests (AJAX)
            - Ease of using AJAX libraries
            - Doesn't involve Flask
            - Can be faster
        - Server side requests
            - Bypass same-origin policy which blocks browser requests
            - Server can store and process data
            - Some API requires keys or authentication and authorization


        Python requests
        ===============
        - pip install requests
        - requests.get(url, params={})
        - requests.post(url, data={}, json={})
            - content-type of data = application/w-xxx-form-urlencoded
                - not good for nested or complex json
            - content-type of json = application/json
        - response.json()
        - response.status_code
        - response.text


        API Keys
        ========
        - Many APIs requires a key and a secret
            - like username and password
        - Gives access to confidential data or sensitive information
        - Some APIs cost money to use
        - Limits abuse
        - API Keys ties to user of API
        - Typically register on site to get an API Key
        - How to use
            - May need to include with the request
            - Varies by API
        - from secrets import API_KEY
            - secrets.py
            - do not push to remote


        APIs
        ====
        - MapQuest
        - Twilio - SMS
        - Intellexer - Text Emoting


        SDKs
        ====
        - Some APIs have SDKs
        - Interface for using the API
        - Instead of sending a request using requests or axios
        - Import the SDK, and use the API functions and tools


        Restful Apis
        ============
        - Get
            - Remains in the browser history
            - can be bookmarked and cached
            - Data sent in the URL
            - Repeatable
            - Finding and filtering for data
        - Post
            - Does remain in history, cannot be bookmarked or cached
            - Data sent in the request body
            - Not repeatable
            - Sending emails
            - Updating data
        - Put
            - Not supported by forms
            - Update an entire resource
        - Patch 
            - Not supported by forms
            - Update part of a resource
        - Delete
            - Not supported by forms
            - Delete a resource
        - POST /v1/boards/board
        

        Safety and Idempotency
        ======================
        - Safe operations do not change data
        - Idempotent operations are repeatable operations with the same result
        - GET is safe and idempotent
        - POST is not safe and is not idempotent
        - PUT/PATCH/DELETE is not safe but are idempotent
        - Better create routes, restful apis


        REST
        ====
        - Architectural style defining constrainst for creating web services
            - client server model
            - statelessness
            - cacheability
        - APIs that adhere to these contraints are called RESTful Apis
        - Have a base url
        - Resource after base url
        - Uses standard HTTP methods
        - POST commonly responds with 201
